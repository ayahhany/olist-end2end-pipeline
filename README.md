### 1- Transfers:
The data that you will work with is stored in multiple sources. First, some of the tables are stored in a postgres database and some will be retrieved via an API. You are expected to move this data from the different sources to BigQuery. Feel free to use the suitable tool for each source.<br>

### 2- Modeling:
You are expected to apply the necessary modeling techniques to transform the raw data in the landing tables to multiple dimension and fact tables and store them in BigQuery.
